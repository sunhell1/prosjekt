Plan - Prioritylist

1. Cleanup and fixes.
   - Clean up the code. 
   - Move isMoveValid to Sheepherder class.
   - Delete the Board.java class wich basically has the same intended function as Level. 
   - Implement methods for TakeLife ect. into the main scene class (SheepHerder).
   - Make a new Class (enum or static methods) for every sound. 
   - Fix sheep to only have a Point. (Unnecessary functions in sheep)
   - Trim the fat of the Herder class (might not be needed)
   
2. Implement remaining intended features of the game:
   - Pitfalls
   - Trees
   - Rocks
   - Move back to start position after out of bounds or pitfall. 
   - Retry function to function properly. Edit mouseClicked() method. 
   - Banana and beerbottle should consume on use. 
   - Move properly after herder steps on a Banana. (+1 tile each direction)
   - Bigger GridPane (Levels) (see if we can have a dynamic size)
   
3. Implementation after cleanup and fixes (Should be a functioning version)
   - Wolf with an array of moves for each level heading for sheeps. (can wait) 
   - Player Stats. life should be displayed aswell as an inventory. Sheepcounter increment.
   - Beer Animation for drinking a beer.
   - Tree animation
