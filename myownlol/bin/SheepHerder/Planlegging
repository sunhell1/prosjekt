Plan - Prioritylist
   
1. Implement remaining intended features of the game:
   - Pitfalls
   - Trees
   - Rocks
   - Move back to start position after out of bounds or pitfall. 
   - Retry function to function properly. Edit mouseClicked() method. 
   - Banana and beerbottle should consume on use. 
   - Move properly after herder steps on a Banana. (+1 tile each direction)
   - Bigger GridPane (Levels) (see if we can have a dynamic size)
   
2. Implementation after cleanup and fixes (Should be a functioning version)
   - Wolf with an array of moves for each level heading for sheeps. (can wait) 
   - Player Stats. life should be displayed aswell as an inventory. Sheepcounter increment.
   - Beer Animation for drinking a beer.
   - Tree animation
